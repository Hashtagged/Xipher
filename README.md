# Xipher
Xipher is a simple GUI for encrypting/decrypting files using PyQt5 and AES. User can select a file, enter a password and encrypt or decrypt it. The encryption/decryption uses a password-based key generated using PBKDF2. Good for demonstration, but use a vetted library in real-world scenarios.
